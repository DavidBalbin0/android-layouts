## Project Layouts

I developed this project during my Android classes at college. 
It represents my first encounter with Android development and was conceived as an introduction to basic user interface components, such as columns and rows.

The main goal of this project is to explore and understand how these components function within the context of Android development, providing a foundation for future projects.

This screenshot displays the layout design of the project, showcasing the arrangement of basic UI components such as columns and rows.
